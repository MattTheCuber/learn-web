Judas and Steve
"Well," Judas said,  "There isn't much I can say, except, duck!"
Three days ago... 
"Where are you bringing me?" asked Judas to the cannibals as they reached there Chief.
"Mountain kogw neeeewt lemqonee." said there Chief to one of the other cannibals.
"You fine Steve, or we feast." said the translator. "You bring Steve pyramids. Now you leave, or we feast."
"Steve the Great Explorer!" Judas thought to himself, and left to the nearest place around, which is the forest.
 There he found Steve the Great Explorer with his family.
"Steve come some people are in trouble!" Judas lied.
"Family I have to go." Steve said as he ran off to follow Judas.
Meanwhile the cannibal where watching there tracking device as Judas ran off.
Judas and Steve had slowed down and where talking about the location.
"They are at the pyramids about 2ml from here." said Judas.
"People always get trapped in there the only problem is the booby-traps." Steve said.
"Yah." Judas said
"Whats you name?" Steve asked.
"Judas." answered Judas.
1/2 an hour later Judas and Steve entered the pyramids.
"Well," Judas said,  "There isn't much I can say, except, duck!"
Steve ducked just as the arrow went over his head.
"You brought me into the pyramids to get booby-trapped?!?!" asked Steve.
"Yes, no, well, the cannibals told me to bring you here and somehow they now exactly where I am right now." Judas said
"They probably put a tracking device on you." said Steve.
Suddenly the floor beneath them opened up and they where falling through the pyramid. Steve saw some vines.
"Grab some vines." said Steve.
Judas and Steve grabbed some vines and stopped at an opening in the wall.
"Well, we'll have to get out of here before they get back." said Steve, "Over there there's a tunnel."
"Quick the walls are closing in, we better get out quick!" yelled Judas as he was running as fast as he could out to the hole.
Judas and Steve made it out the hole just in time.
